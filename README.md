# 🧠 AI-Powered Smart Vaults for Yield Optimization

## 🔗 Theme: DeFi, Reinvented

This project builds **AI-powered smart vaults** that optimize yield farming strategies across DeFi protocols. It uses off-chain AI logic to automate fund allocation based on real-time APYs, gas fees, and risk scores. The result is a gasless, user-friendly platform for both advanced and non-technical users.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Smart Vault Contracts (Solidity)**:  
  Auto-compounding, strategy rebalancing, dynamic fee logic for withdrawals.
  
- 🧠 **AI Routing Engine (Python)**:  
  Off-chain logic to suggest optimal DeFi strategy based on APY, risk, gas fee.
  
- 🌐 **Frontend Dashboard (React.js)**:  
  Simple UI to deposit/withdraw funds and view vault performance.

- 🔐 **Gasless Wallet Integration**:  
  Supports smart wallets with account abstraction (Biconomy/Safe).

- 🎖️ **NFT Access Control**:  
  ERC-721 based NFT gate to access premium yield strategies.

- 📊 **Real-Time Analytics**:  
  Track TVL, APY trends, and top-earning wallets via charts.
