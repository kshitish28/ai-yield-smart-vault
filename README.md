# 🧠 AI-Powered Smart Vaults for Yield Optimization

## 🔗 Theme: DeFi, Reinvented

This project builds **AI-powered smart vaults** that optimize yield farming strategies across DeFi protocols. It uses off-chain AI logic to automate fund allocation based on real-time APYs, gas fees, and risk scores. The result is a gasless, user-friendly platform for both advanced and non-technical users.
